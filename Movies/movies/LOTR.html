    <b>The Fellowship of the Ring</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    The story begins in the peaceful Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits a seemingly innocent ring from his uncle, Bilbo. However, the wizard Gandalf soon reveals that this is the One Ring, a powerful artifact created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle-earth. Sauron is seeking the Ring to regain his full strength and plunge the world into darkness.
    <br><br>
    To stop Sauron, the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was forged. Frodo is chosen to carry out this perilous mission. He is joined by a diverse group of companions: Gandalf, Aragorn (a ranger and the true king of Gondor), Legolas (an Elven prince), Gimli (a Dwarf warrior), Boromir (a man of Gondor), and his three hobbit friends, Sam, Merry, and Pippin.
    <br><br>
    Together, they form the Fellowship of the Ring. Their journey is fraught with danger as they traverse treacherous landscapes, face the evil Ringwraiths, and confront internal conflicts. The Fellowship eventually breaks, but Frodo continues his journey to Mordor, accompanied by Sam, while the others pursue their own paths in the war against Sauron.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    <b>The Two Towers</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    The second volume splits into multiple storylines. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor, guided by Gollum, a twisted creature who was once the Ring's bearer. Gollum's intentions are ambiguous as he struggles between his loyalty to Frodo and his obsession with the Ring.
    <br><br>
    Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin. The two hobbits manage to escape and encounter Treebeard, an Ent, who helps them rally the ancient tree-like beings to attack Saruman, Sauron's ally.
    <br><br>
    The forces of good face increasingly dire situations as Sauron's power grows. In the kingdom of Rohan, King Théoden, initially under Saruman's spell, is freed by Gandalf and rallies his people to defend their land from an onslaught of orcs. The battle at Helm's Deep becomes a critical point, with the arrival of Gandalf and the Riders of Rohan turning the tide against Saruman's forces.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    <b>The Two Towers</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    In the final volume, the story reaches its climactic conclusion. As Sauron prepares for his final assault on Gondor, the city of Minas Tirith braces for war. Aragorn, revealing himself as the true king, seeks to unite the forces of men, elves, and the undead army of the Dead Men of Dunharrow to stand against Sauron.
    <br><br>
    The Battle of Pelennor Fields becomes one of the most epic confrontations in Middle-earth, with Éowyn and Merry notably defeating the Witch-king of Angmar. Despite their efforts, Sauron's forces are overwhelming, and Aragorn leads a desperate march to the Black Gate of Mordor as a diversion, giving Frodo and Sam a chance to reach Mount Doom.
    <br><br>
    In Mordor, Frodo succumbs to the Ring's power at the last moment, but Gollum, driven by his obsession, bites off Frodo's finger and accidentally falls into the fire, destroying the Ring and Sauron along with it. The destruction of the Ring signals the end of Sauron's reign, and peace returns to Middle-earth.
    <br><br>
    Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor, and the various races of Middle-earth come together in a fragile peace. The hobbits return to the Shire, which they find in turmoil due to Saruman's influence, but they restore it. Frodo, however, remains wounded by his experiences and eventually departs Middle-earth with Gandalf, Bilbo, and the elves, leaving Sam to continue his life in the Shire.
