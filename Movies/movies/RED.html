    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    The film centers around Frank Moses (Bruce Willis), a retired CIA black-ops agent living a quiet, lonely life in the suburbs. His only joy comes from talking on the phone with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker), a government pension office worker. Frank’s mundane existence is shattered when a team of assassins suddenly shows up at his house and tries to kill him.
    <br><br>
Realizing that his life is in danger, Frank reassembles his old team of operatives to find out who is targeting them and why. This team includes Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman), an elderly but still sharp ex-CIA agent; Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), a paranoid and eccentric former agent who believes the government has been trying to kill him for years; and Victoria (Helen Mirren), a refined but lethal former MI6 assassin.
<br><br>
As Frank and his team dig deeper, they uncover a conspiracy that goes all the way to the highest levels of the U.S. government. The conspiracy is connected to a secret mission from their past, which involves a cover-up and powerful figures who want to ensure that the truth never comes out.
<br><br>
Throughout their mission, the team engages in a series of action-packed confrontations, using their unique skills and experience to outmaneuver their younger, less-experienced adversaries. Along the way, Frank and Sarah’s relationship deepens, adding a romantic subplot to the film’s mix of action and comedy.
<br><br>
The movie culminates in a showdown in Washington, D.C., where Frank and his team confront the mastermind behind the plot, revealing the corruption and betrayal that led to their targeting. In the end, the team prevails, and Frank and Sarah ride off together, hinting at a new beginning for them.
