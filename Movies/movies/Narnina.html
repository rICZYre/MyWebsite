    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    One year after their adventure in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Pevensie siblings—Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy—are waiting at a train station when they are suddenly transported back to Narnia. They find themselves in the ruins of their former castle, Cair Paravel, and realize that hundreds of years have passed in Narnia since they were last there.
    <br><br>
    They soon learn that Narnia is now under the oppressive rule of the Telmarines, a human race that has conquered Narnia and driven the magical creatures into hiding. The rightful heir to the throne, Prince Caspian, has fled from his evil uncle, King Miraz, who has usurped the throne and seeks to kill Caspian to secure his own power.
    <br><br>
    Caspian, having been raised to believe that the old Narnia was just a myth, learns the truth about the magical creatures and ancient traditions from his tutor, Doctor Cornelius. After escaping his uncle's clutches, Caspian blows the magical horn of Queen Susan (left behind in Narnia from the Pevensies' first visit), which summons the Pevensie siblings to Narnia.
    <br><br>
    The Pevensies join forces with Caspian and the remaining Old Narnians—talking animals, dwarfs, fauns, and others—to mount a rebellion against Miraz. The battle is difficult, as the Telmarines are formidable warriors, and Caspian's forces are outnumbered. However, with the arrival of Aslan, the great lion and true king of Narnia, the tide turns.
    <br><br>
    Aslan awakens the spirits of the trees and other magical forces of Narnia, which terrify the Telmarines. Eventually, Peter challenges King Miraz to single combat to decide the fate of Narnia. Miraz accepts, but is treacherously killed by his own lords, leading to a full-scale battle between the Narnians and Telmarines. With Aslan’s help, the Narnians emerge victorious.
    <br><br>
    After the battle, Aslan offers the Telmarines a chance to return to their original world, and many accept. Caspian is crowned King of Narnia, and the Pevensies realize that this will be their last trip to Narnia, as Peter and Susan are told they are too old to return. They say their goodbyes and are returned to their world.
