        <p><b>Iguazu Falls</b> One of the main reasons I wanted to visit Iguazu Falls was to witness the breathtaking spectacle of Devil's Throat, the largest and most mesmerizing waterfall in the complex. I had read about the U-shaped chasm where the majority of the Iguazu River's water plunges down into the abyss, and I was eager to walk along the elevated walkways and get as close as possible to this natural wonder. Feeling the mist on my skin and hearing the thunderous roar of the water as it cascades down would be an experience unlike any other.</p> 

        <p>Additionally, I was excited to explore both the Upper and Lower Circuits of the falls to appreciate the different perspectives they offer. From the Upper Circuit, I hoped to take in panoramic views of the entire waterfall complex, marveling at the vastness and beauty of the cascades from above. On the Lower Circuit, I looked forward to getting closer to the base of the falls, feeling the spray of the water and witnessing the sheer power of nature up close.</p>
