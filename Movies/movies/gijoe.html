    <b>Synopsis</b><br><br>
    The movie begins with the G.I. Joe team on a mission to retrieve a nuclear warhead in Pakistan. However, they are soon betrayed and ambushed by the U.S. government, which has been infiltrated by the Cobra organization. Most of the Joes are killed in the attack, with only a few surviving: Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki).
    <br><br>
    The surviving Joes realize that the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce) has been replaced by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), a Cobra operative who can mimic anyone's appearance. Under Zartan's influence, Cobra takes control of the U.S. government and manipulates global leaders, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war.
    <br><br>
    Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye, along with new allies, must regroup and find a way to stop Cobra. They seek out the original G.I. Joe commander, General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who helps them mount a counteroffensive.
    <br><br>
    Meanwhile, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and his apprentice Jinx (Elodie Yung) undertake a separate mission to capture Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun), who is believed to have assassinated the original G.I. Joe leader, General Hawk. However, they discover that Storm Shadow was framed and that he, too, seeks revenge against Cobra for manipulating him.
    <br><br>
    The film's climax takes place at the world leaders' summit, where Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) plans to force the world's nuclear powers to disarm their weapons, leaving Cobra as the only armed force. The Joes launch a daring assault to stop Cobra's plan, leading to an explosive showdown.
    <br><br>
    In the end, the Joes succeed in exposing Cobra's plot, rescuing the President, and restoring order. However, Cobra Commander escapes, setting the stage for future battles between G.I. Joe and Cobra.
